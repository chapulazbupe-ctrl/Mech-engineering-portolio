# Aircraft Propulsion – Turbojet Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project involved analysing the performance of a turbojet engine using experimental facility data and thermodynamic calculations. The aim was to evaluate engine efficiency, work transfer, and flow properties, while understanding real-world propulsion system behaviour.

## Objectives
- Calculate stagnation enthalpies across engine stages  
- Determine compressor and turbine work output  
- Evaluate heat input and net work losses  
- Calculate compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies  
- Determine mass flow rate, fuel-air ratio, and exit velocity  
- Analyse measurement accuracy and thermodynamic assumptions  
- Investigate aircraft engine noise sources and mitigation strategies  

## Tools & Methods
- Engineering thermodynamics calculations  
- Experimental engine data analysis  
- Spreadsheet-based computation of performance parameters  
- Fluid flow and energy balance equations  

## Key Outcomes
- Quantified compressor and turbine efficiencies from experimental data  
- Determined thrust-related flow parameters including mass flow rate and exit velocity  
- Evaluated energy losses and system performance limitations  
- Developed understanding of propulsion system design trade-offs and environmental considerations
