# Control System Modelling & PID Design – MATLAB/Simulink

## Overview
This project focused on modelling, analysing, and controlling a rectilinear vibration system using experimental data and simulation tools. The objective was to identify system dynamics, design feedback controllers, and evaluate system performance through MATLAB and Simulink simulations.

## Objectives
- Identify system parameters from experimental encoder data  
- Derive the transfer function of the rectilinear vibration system  
- Analyse open-loop system response characteristics  
- Design proportional and PID controllers  
- Evaluate system performance using transient response metrics  
- Tune controller gains to meet design specifications  
- Compare simulation results with experimental laboratory data  

## Tools & Methods
- MATLAB scripting for system modelling and response analysis  
- MATLAB Control System Toolbox for transfer function modelling  
- Simulink / Simscape for dynamic system simulation  
- Root locus techniques and PID auto-tuning methods  
- Calculation of transient response measures including:
  - Overshoot
  - Rise time
  - Settling time
  - Peak time
  - Steady-state error

## Key Outcomes
- Successfully derived system parameters and transfer function from experimental data  
- Simulated proportional and PID-controlled responses in MATLAB and Simulink  
- Demonstrated how controller gains affect transient response and system stability  
- Designed PID controller meeting specified performance criteria  
- Validated model accuracy by comparing simulated results with laboratory measurements
