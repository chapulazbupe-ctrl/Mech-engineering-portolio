## About Me
I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from De Montfort University with experience in engineering design, simulation, and system modelling. My work combines theoretical engineering analysis with practical applications, including CAD development, structural simulation, and dynamic system control.

This portfolio showcases selected academic and technical projects demonstrating my ability to:

- Model and analyse engineering systems  
- Design components using CAD and engineering standards  
- Perform simulation-driven optimisation  
- Interpret experimental data and validate models  
- Produce professional engineering documentation
