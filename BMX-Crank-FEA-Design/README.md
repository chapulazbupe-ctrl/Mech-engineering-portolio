# BMX Crank Arm – CAD Design and Structural FEA Optimisation

## Overview
This project involved designing a high-performance BMX crank arm from concept through to manufacturable engineering design. The work focused on achieving an optimal strength-to-weight ratio using CAD modelling and structural finite element analysis (FEA).

## Objectives
- Develop multiple crank arm design concepts  
- Create detailed 3D CAD model and assembly  
- Produce engineering drawings compliant with BS 8888 / ISO standards  
- Perform structural FEA to evaluate stress and deformation  
- Optimise geometry to improve strength while reducing weight  
- Ensure manufacturability of the final design  

## Tools & Methods
- 3D CAD modelling and assembly design  
- Engineering drawing generation  
- Finite Element Analysis for stress and deformation assessment  
- Iterative design refinement based on simulation results  

## Key Outcomes
- Produced a fully detailed manufacturable crank arm design  
- Generated professional engineering drawings  
- Identified critical stress regions and improved structural performance  
- Achieved improved strength-to-weight ratio through simulation-driven optimisation
